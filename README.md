<h1 align="center">Features</h1>

### Performance
Having poured lots of hours into examining generated C# code and its JIT assembly, you can count on us to deliver blazing fast bindings with negligible overhead induced by Silk.NET!

### Up-to-date
With an efficient bindings regeneration mechanism, we are committed to ensuring our bindings reflect the latest specifications with monthly updates generated straight from the upstream sources.

### High-level utilities
In addition to providing high-speed, direct, and transparent bindings, we provide high-level utilities and wrappers to maximise productivity in common workloads such as platform-agnostic abstractions around Windowing and Input, bringing your apps to a vast number of platforms without changing a single line!

### Good-to-go
Silk.NET caters for anything you could need in swift development of multimedia, graphics, compute applications. Silk.NET is an all-in-one solution, complete with Graphics, Compute, Audio, Input, and Windowing.

<h1 align="center">The team</h1>

We currently have the following maintainers:
- [Dylan P.](https://github.com/Perksey) from [Ultz](https://github.com/Ultz)
- [Kai J.](https://github.com/HurricanKai) from the open-source community

In addition, the Silk.NET working group help drive larger user-facing changes providing key consultation from the perspective of dedicated users and professionals.

<h1 align="center">Building from source</h1>

- Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed
- Clone the repository
- Run `nuke build`

There are more advanced build actions you can do too, such as FullBuild, Pack, FullPack, among others which you can view by doing `nuke --plan`.

Some projects may not build properly without being configured to use Desktop MSBuild (i.e. the MSBuild shipped with Visual Studio). As a result, you will ideally need to be on Windows and have Visual Studio 2019 Community (or greater) installed with .NET Core and Xamarin workloads. If you don't have this (i.e. because you're on Linux or Mac), you can still develop Silk.NET in a limited capacity but you will not be able to work on mobile workloads.

<h1 align="center">Contributing</h1>

Silk.NET uses and encourages [Early Pull Requests](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6). Please don't wait until you're done to open a PR!

1. [Fork Silk.NET](https://github.com/Ultz/Silk.NET/fork)
2. Add an empty commit to a new branch to start your work off: `git commit --allow-empty -m "start of [thing you're working on]"`
3. Once you've pushed a commit, open a Pull Request with `[WIP]` in the title. Do this **before** you actually start working.
4. Make your commits in small, incremental steps with clear descriptions.
5. Tag a maintainer when you're done and ask for a review!
